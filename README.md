# CGM-2005-RFS-Matlab-Octave
Replication of Figure 2 in Cocco, Gomes and Maenhout (2005, Review of Financial Studies).

Run Main.m to replicate Figure 2 in the paper. The files run both in Matlab and in Octave.
Matlab takes some 10 minutes. Octave requires a substantially longer runtime, of about 12 hours.
The folder FORTRAN contains programs and results made available by Francisco Gomes.
